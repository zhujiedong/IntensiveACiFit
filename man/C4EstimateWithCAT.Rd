\item{ACi}{Gas exchange measurement from Li6400 or other
equipment. It is a dataframe iput. Ci with the unit of ppm.}

\item{alpha1}{The fraction of O2 evolution occurring in the bundle sheath.

used for the PEP regeneration out of J, which is the total electron transport.}

\value{
This package will return a dataframe that
contains the following values
(c(Vcmax,J,Rd,gm,Vpmax and KCA)). You can try with c(30, 150, 3, 10, 50, 80).

Parameter at leaf temperature:  A vector (c(Vcmax,J,Rd,gm,Vpmax and
KCA)) returns the estimation parameters at leaf temperature.

Parameter at 25Â°C:   A vector (c(Vcmax,J,Rd,gm,Vpmax and
KCA)) returns the estimation parameters at leaf temperature.

Objective:     The final objective value based on
the estimation results.

Convergence:  An integer code. 0 indicates
successful convergence.

Message:	 A character string giving any
additional information returned by the optimizer, or NULL.
For details, see PORT documentation.

Iterations:	  Number of iterations performed.

Evaluations:  Number of objective function and
gradient function evaluations.

\description{
Using the gas exchange measurement (A_Ci curve),
C4 photosynthesis model with
carbonic anhydrase reaction and Sharkey et al. (2007)
fitting processure to do nonlinear curve fitting
(using nlminb package) for estimating photosynthesis
parameters (Vcmax,J,Rd,gm and Vpmax) for C4 species.
The difference between this method with C4EstimateWithCA
is that temperature response parameters need to be provided
by the users. Thus, this method provides the option
to alter temperature response parameters. If only planing
to alter several parameters, not all of them, one can use
the other parameters provided by
Table S1 in Zhou et al. (2019) ("Deriving C4 photosynthesis
parameters by fitting intensive A/Ci curves"). Make sure to
load the "stats" package before intstalling and using
the "C4Estimation" package.
